     <p>Hi there, I am a golden fish . I live in the water and I can breathe there,I can't breathe on land and i can die. I have different species. I can be kept as a pet and can be eaten too, but it depends on your choice.Well I prefer to be kept as a pet so that i wil live longer and grow bigger.  </p>
